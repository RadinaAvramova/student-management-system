# Student Management System 
Welcome to the Student Management System project! This C++ application is designed to manage student records, including information such as student names, IDs, grades, and courses. With this system, educational institutions can efficiently store, retrieve, and update student data, streamlining administrative tasks and improving record-keeping accuracy.

## Features
1. **Student Registration:** Allows administrators to register new students into the system by entering their personal information such as name, ID, and contact details.

2. **Course Enrollment:** Enables administrators to enroll students in courses by assigning them to specific classes or programs offered by the institution.

3. **Grade Management:** Provides functionality to record and manage student grades for each enrolled course, including assignments, exams, and final grades.

4. **Attendance Tracking:** Tracks student attendance for each class or course, allowing administrators to monitor student participation and performance.

5. **Search and Retrieval:** Supports search and retrieval of student records based on various criteria such as name, ID, course, or grade, facilitating quick access to relevant information.

6. **Update and Delete Records:** Allows administrators to update student information and grades as needed, as well as delete records for students who have graduated or withdrawn from courses.

7. **Report Generation:*8 Generates reports and summaries of student data, including class rosters, grade reports, attendance records, and more, to support administrative decision-making and reporting requirements.
